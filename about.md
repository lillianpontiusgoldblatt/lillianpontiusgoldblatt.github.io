## Career Highlights
- Studied fiction writing in college, a degree that has proven itself to be surprisingly useful in professional life.
- Ran youth programs in nonprofits for seven years. Everyone should spend time working with children at some point. It teaches resolve, humility, fortitude and grit. It also trains you to present without fear and not to get squeamish answering hard questions.
- Worked full-time while completing NYU Sternâ€™s MBA program to better understand how organizations create impact, grow sustainably and communicate their value.
- Did a little bit of everything at a medtech startup working to democratize vision care; from finance to HR to marketing and beyond. Here, launched a brand strategy task force to help define core values and the promise we made customers. It was this task force and a NYU capstone brand strategy class with a CSA designer that lead to Carbone Smolan Agency.
- Currently, as a Senior Strategist, leads client relationships, plans and conducts research, develops insights, conducts workshops and trainings, crafts positioning and architecture, writes evocative copy and more to build alignment so that clients and their organizations can succeed.

## Expertise
Brand Strategy, Messaging, Brand Architecture, Workshops, Storytelling, Public Speaking

## Public Speaking
I love public speaking; pitching concepts, planning engaging talks, and working out activities people will care about and take something from. In my day job this takes the form of workshops and presentations. Outside of works this mean finding places where my ideas and work will be relevant to audiences.
