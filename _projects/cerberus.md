## The Challenge
After a [successful identity and web design project with Cerberus Capital Management](https://helendear.com/project/cerberus), Cerberus came to us with a different kind of assignment. Cerberus is a private equity firm and had recently acquired a mid-market insurance servicer that was emerging from bankruptcy and a major leadership transition. To aid this transition, the firm needed a fast and expert rebrand that reflected their new leadership and strengthened market position.

## The Tasks
**Brand Platform**  
In this 8 week sprint, design director Helen Dear and I worked in close collaboration to define the brand platform and develop an identity and visual tool kit. To do this we squeezed value from every client interaction, using meetings to uncover insight into the organization and developing a lightning fast workshop covering strategy, design and execution.

**Identity**  
Helen and I worked closely on several projects while we were both at CSA and developed a highly collaborative and strategic partnership. You can read more about the design process on [Helenâ€™s](https://helendear.com/project/carrier-technology-solutions) website.
