## The Challenge
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care was coming off of a few hard years. Financial losses, leadership transitions and a drop in service reviews. The company’s new CMO was looking for help, not only in refreshing the design system, but in finding ways to help his department work better for the organization. In this ongoing relationship, we partner with internal teams to roll out initiatives across the organization.

## The Tasks
**Brand Messaging**
There are many writers at Harvard Pilgrim. Marketers, sales teams, plan specialists, medical professionals, community liaisons, foundation spokespeople and more are all creating content for the organization. In an industry known for impenetrable vernacular and unwieldy messaging, it was a top priority to unify the voice, tone and priorities of or the organizations publications. We created guidelines to be applied across the brand architecture and samples messages for key entities. To activate these guidelines we developed and delivered training workshops for 60+ or the writers and content creators across the organization.

**Custom Photo Library**
Harvard Pilgrim wanted to create a custom photo library to use across their materials. With community and inclusion being central to the HPHC brand we developed a narrative consisting of six interconnected families that created a diverse and dynamic community of characters that would be unique to Harvard Pilgrim and come to be representatives of the HPHC community in the minds of their customers, employees and broker. We art directed these images in studio and location shoots across the Boston area. These images have been used across HPHC created materials and by advertising partner, Hill Holiday.
