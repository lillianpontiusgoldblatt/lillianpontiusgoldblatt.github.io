## The Challenge
Cravath, Swaine & Moore is one of America's oldest and most prestigious law firms. 2019 marks the firms 200th anniversary, an occasion to be celebrated internally and externally. Cravath engaged CSA to create a microsite celebrating the anniversary and SYPartners to produce a book to be distributed throughout the year.

## The Tasks
**Content Strategy**  
As content strategist on this project, in tandem with digital strategist Grace Paik, my task was to align the microsite content with SYP's book content in a clear and compelling way for the microsite. With a timeline of hundreds of data points over the firm's 200 year history our team prioritized and simplified our content for a broad, digital audience. Working closely with the design team we paired copy with photography, illustration and typography to create a diverse and compelling reading experience.
