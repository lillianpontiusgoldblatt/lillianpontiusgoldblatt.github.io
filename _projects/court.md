## The Challenge
Carbone Smolan Agency has a long history of serving the legal industry. The agency has deep expertise and long-standing relationships with the top firms in the world. In my tenure at the agency I have worked with law clients on a number of small, brand-building projects.


### Cahill Gordon & Reindel
**Women of Cahill Book**  
To support Cahill's Women's Initiatives Committee I developed a theme and content strategy for a book celebrating Cahill's women leaders.

### Latham & Watkins
**Recruiting Campaign**
We were asked to create a campaign to support Latham's 2018 on campus recruiting efforts During this project I learned a great deal about this vital component of the hiring cycle at Latham and in the industry broadly through recent recruit, HR leadership and partner interviews. This campaign connects to Latham's existing materials through content and stands out from the crowd in a dense and often homogenous landscape.

### Kirkland Ellis
**Pitch Deck**  
In the fall of 2018, Kirkland launch a new website with a refreshed brand. To help activate the new system internally they asked CSA to design a unified and sophisticated new template for the pitch decks their business development teams use across the globe. Through a thorough materials audit and extensive international stakeholder interviews we created a beautiful and high functioning tool to make life just a little bit easier for these hard working teams.
