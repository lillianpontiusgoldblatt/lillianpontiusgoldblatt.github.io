## The Challenge
The Edward Hopper House is the childhood home of the iconic American painter Edward Hopper. The once abandoned historical site in Nyack, New York was restored by a dedicated team of local art enthusiasts and functioned for many years as a community arts center. As they grew in size and scope the board as staff sought to professionalize the organization and reposition it as a museum a study center dedicated to the study of Edward Hopper’s work, history and legacy.

## The Tasks
**Brand Platform**  
Edward Hopper House’s brand platform was a labor of love done in collaboration with fellow strategist [Jennifer Passas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-passas-70697523). Together we defined a lean but efficient research methodology aimed at uncovering insights about the organization, the community and the the place American artist Edward Hopper holds in the public consciousness. The result of this work was a brand platform aimed at design execution and a brand story useful across marketing, fundraising and programmatic materials.

**Board Workshop**  
A foundational component of this project was engaging the board of directors with the brand as an extension of the organization’s strategic plan. We developed a workshop to deliver insights, solicit input and building alignment.

**Identity**
Under creative director [Kimiyo Nakatsui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimiyo-nakatsui-8011b469/) and senior designer [Jaime Patino-Calvo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaime-patino-calvo-a6434952/), we delivered a design system that both spoke to the strategic needs of the organization and its new positioning and beautifully evoked Edward Hopper’s legacy.

**Activation Ideation**
As an extension of the platform and identity we developed a set of activation concepts for the organization. These ranged from easy and affordable executions to experimental community engagements.
