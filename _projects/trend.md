In the fall of 2017 my colleague [Jennifer Passas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-passas-70697523/) launched Carbone Smolan Agency's trend reporting practice. The goals of this practice were to develop our strategy team through immersion and exploration of the innovations happening across the industries we serve, while creating valuable content for new business and marketing at the agency. When Jennifer left CSA for Gensler's brand group in 2018, I took over leadership of this practice. Since it's inception it has become a value part of the success of our team and presentations of each report have become mainstay at all-staff meetings.

**The Process**  
Each report starts with a conversation with CSA leadership. Based on new business meeting, client needs and team requests we determine a topic for the upcoming report. Research extends from industry focus, to marketing topics, to consumer segments. Once a topic is selected the strategy team, currently made up of [Grace Paik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/grace-paik/), [Michael Marotta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-marotta-nyc/) and myself, spend a few hours a week looking at innovation, transformation and generally cool stuff happening connected with that topic. Armed with the most compelling of these examples we come together, report out our findings and look for patterns. After our work sessions one of us, usually me, takes the insights of this session and writes a summation to be distributed internally and externally.

**South by Southwest**  
Building on this practice, Jennifer Passas and I pitched a new idea to leadership. We saw an opportunity to better understand the trends of the market and the landscape where our clients operate, by attending one of the largest commercial conferences in the world. In 2017 we lobbied for and won funding from CSA to attend South by Southwest 2018. This was the first time CSA  sent strategists to a conference. It was a great experience. We learned a lot, brought back the knowledge to our colleagues in the office and [created content to share with our clients](https://www.carbonesmolan.com/press/bravery-sustainability-and-your-future-audience-trends-from-sxsw.html).

The next logical step was to participate. In 2018 we were accepted to present a [workshop on the practice that brought us there in the first place](https://schedule.sxsw.com/2019/events/PP87035).

Our workshop filled up almost immediately and SXSW asked us to offer an encore. I was immensely impressed with the enthusiasm of our attendees, engaging with the materials and with each other.
